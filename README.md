# IR-SENSOR-WITH-IR-REMOTE

What is an IR Sensor?
IR sensor is an electronic device, that emits the light in order to sense some object of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion. Usually, in the infrared spectrum, all the objects radiate some form of thermal radiation. These types of radiations are invisible to our eyes, but infrared sensor can detect these radiations.

Here is the basic circuit to understand the working of remotes we daily use like the one in our television. Our remote have a IR led and IR receiver is there in tv that detect the incoming signal. We can see in code some HEXA decimal number which have been written after the response of certain key was noted from remote. Each key gives out a specific signal which is recieved by receiver and than after that after the response of each key was nited we adjusted it accordin to our need and instructed arduino if thta particular type of HEXA signal is detected it will react according to the code we have given it.
